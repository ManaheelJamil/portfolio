            Hello, my name is Manheel Jameel and I am a BS (Mathematics) student at Federal Urdu University. In addition to my studies, I have also completed a Mern Stack course in Syalni and am currently pursuing a WEB 3.0 Metaverse course at PIAIC.

With my education and training, I have developed expertise in MongoDB and Tailwind CSS. I am passionate about using my skills to create innovative solutions and push the boundaries of what is possible in the digital realm.

My goal is to leverage my knowledge and experience to make a positive impact in the world, whether it's through developing new software applications or contributing to existing projects. I am always eager to learn and grow, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
